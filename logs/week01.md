## Day 1 â€“ July 15, 2025
**Goal:** Begin reading Beejâ€™s Guide and prep project with basic includes

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered

#### Beejâ€™s Guide â€” Chapter 2 & 3

- Everything in UNIX is a file (including sockets)
- Sockets use file descriptors; `send()` and `recv()` offer more control than `read()`/`write()`
- 3 socket types:
  - Internet sockets (our focus)
  - UNIX domain sockets (local interprocess)
  - X.25 (ignored)
- Encapsulation: Data is wrapped at each network layer â†’ then unwrapped by recipient

#### Network Layer Models
- OSI model (Application â†’ Physical)
- UNIX model: Application â†’ Transport (TCP) â†’ Internet (IP) â†’ Network Access

#### IPv4 vs IPv6
- IPv4 address space is nearly exhausted
- IPv6 allows an extremely large address pool

#### Ports
- IP = street address, Port = room number
- Ports <1024 require elevated permissions

#### Byte Order
- Network Byte Order = Big Endian
- Use conversion functions: `htons()`, `ntohs()`, `htonl()`, `ntohl()`

#### Key Structs
- `struct addrinfo` â€” hostname and service lookup
- `struct sockaddr` â€” generic socket address
- `struct sockaddr_in` â€” IPv4-specific structure

#### Reflections
- This stuff is actually clicking more than I expected.
- I get how everything is a file now â€” even sockets â€” and thatâ€™s kinda wild.
- Reading Beej's guide helped me understand how data gets wrapped and unwrapped as it moves through the network.
- I didnâ€™t write much code yet, but Iâ€™m starting to see the big picture of how all the pieces connect.
- I'm learning before jumping into the hard parts, and that feels like the right move.
- Tomorrow Iâ€™ll start trying out socket(), bind(), and listen() â€” excited to actually get something working.
